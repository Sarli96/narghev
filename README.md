1.	I'm interested in QA, because development cannot go without testing. And the main purpose of QA is to keep an eye on production and development, test and improve them.
2.	My favorite programming language is C# . This is a simple, but powerful addition to a programming language.
3.	A linked list is a linear collection of data elements and each element points to the next.
4.	For the first I will apologize for delay. And I'll ask who is the first and what kind of ice-cream he/she want.
5.	Test the pen.
Verify the dimension of the pen.
Verify the weight of the pen
Verify by writing on a piece of paper
Verify by writing on different types of surfaces
Verify if the text written by pen is erasable or not
Verify the pen's ink is waterproof or not
Verify if the text written by pen is erasable or not
Verify text written by pen doesn't get faded before a certain time as per the specification
Verify the color of the ink of the pen
Verify if the pen is with cap or without cap…
6.	Load/Performance test
Stress test
Usability test
7.	X = (sum of all numbers from 1 to 1.000.000) – (sum of all numbers that we have in list)
8.	360/12=30 (at 3:20, the minute hand will be perfectly horizontal pointing towards 3, whereas the hour hand will be moving towards 4), the answer is 20 degree. 

9.	static bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) 
    { 
        if (n == 0) 
            return false; 
          
        while (n != 1) { 
            if (n % 2 != 0) 
                return false; 
                  
            n = n / 2; 
        } 
        return true; 
    } 
10.	we can use the Distinct extension method 
11.	
 for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) { 
  
        if (str[i] == str[i + 1]) { 
            return false; 
        } 
    } 
    return true; 
12.	 
public string Reverse( string s )
{
char[ ] charArray = s.ToCharArray();
Array.Reverse( charArray );
return new string( charArray );
}

16.	Start moving up in increments of 10 floors and dropping the bulb until it breaks (ie: drop from floor 10, if it doesn't break, drop from floor 20, etc.) Once the bulb breaks, move down to the floor before it broke on and start moving up floors in increments of one until the second bulb breaks. This results in a worst case scenario of 19 drops.
17.	If the strength of slab is in doubt, provide I section below the slab as shown. This method is widely used in many places. If done properly, you may even construct ordinary concrete blocks for the walls above it.
18.	Compare any of the two sets. If both weighs the same, it means the last set has the heavier ball. Weigh 2 balls of that set, if both ball weighs the same then last ball of that set is heavier. Else the heavier ball is the heavier in the last set.
Lets go to step1 again.
- If the first 2 sets are unequal, extract the heavier set, weigh the 2 balls out of it, if they are equal then the third one is heavier, else the heavier ball is heavier.
So, 2 iterations are minimum.
